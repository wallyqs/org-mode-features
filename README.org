* Org mode features

This project attempt at documenting Org mode features 
and how they map in Org ruby.

Take a look at the =features.org= file to see what is implemented
and what has not been implemented yet.

Org babel is used throughout the document to create examples
within the =features/= folder.

The following rake task will try to render the examples using
both Emacs Lisp and Ruby's implementation of the parser.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
rake export_all
#+END_SRC

** Notes

- Currently, the feature examples have been exported
  with Org mode version 7.8 only

- The rake task only works in OS X, needs to be tweaked too.
