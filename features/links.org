* Links to other org files

  This is a link to the ~code-comment.org~ file in the same
  directory. In ~emacs~, if you click it, the other file opens. We
  want the same behavior in the HTML export.

  [[file:code-comment.org][Code Comment]]

* Search links

  This is a search link into code-comment.org.

  [[file:code-comment.org::*Code%20Comment][Code Comment]]

- [[http://foo.org/foo.org][foo.org/foo.org]]

- [[http://localhost:4567/foo.org][localhost:4567/foo.org]]

* In these links, .org is converted to .html
